# Model Improvements Notes

## Current Performance (v3.0.0)
- Base accuracy: ~96% (4% error margin)
- Test case: 1.48L prediction had 0.06L difference (4% error)

## Observations and Potential Improvements

### Audio Processing
1. First chunk consistently shows higher predictions
   - Possible causes:
     - Initial audio spike/noise
     - Startup water flow characteristics
   - Potential solutions:
     - Add noise reduction for initial chunk
     - Consider weighted averaging for chunks
     - Investigate audio normalization techniques

### Model Architecture
1. Current approach: Processing 3-second chunks independently
   - Could benefit from:
     - Sequential/temporal analysis between chunks
     - LSTM/RNN layers for temporal patterns
     - Attention mechanisms for important audio features

### Data Processing
1. Current preprocessing:
   - 20 MFCCs
   - 16kHz sampling rate
   - 3-second chunks
   - 200 timesteps
   - Improvements to consider:
     - Additional audio features (spectral centroid, rolloff)
     - Dynamic chunk sizing based on flow patterns
     - Advanced normalization techniques

### Overall Performance:
  - Average error: 1.8% (better than the expected 4%)
  - Best prediction: 2.60L file (0.4% error)
  - Highest error: 1.48L file (4.0% error)

### Future Work
1. Investigate why first chunks tend to predict higher values
2. Consider implementing a sliding window approach
3. Explore ensemble predictions across different chunk sizes
4. Add confidence scores for predictions
5. Implement outlier detection for anomalous chunks
